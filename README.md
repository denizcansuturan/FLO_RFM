## **Problems:**

1. FLO includes a new women's shoe brand. The product prices of the brand it includes are above the general customer preferences.For this reason, customers in the profile who will be interested in the promotion of the brand and product sales are requested to be contacted privately.From their loyal customers (champions,loyal_customers), the customers who shop in the women category with an average of 250 TL or more will be contacted privately.Import Id numbers of these customers to csv file and save it as new_brand_target_customer_id.cvs.

2. Up to 40% discount is planned for Men's and Children's products. Customers related to this sale are can't loose customers, those who are asleep and new customers. Enter the ids of the customers in the appropriate profile into the csv file as discount_target_customer_ids.csv
